The logic required to make a decision is specific to a single domain and task. Changing the task even slightly might require a rewrite of the whole system. Designing rules requires a deep understanding of how a decision should be made by a human expert. One example of where this handcoded approach will fail is in detecting faces in images. Today, every smartphone can detect a face in an image. However, face detec- tion was an unsolved problem until as recently as 2001. The main problem is that the way in which pixels (which make up an image in a computer) are \"perceived\" by the computer is very different from how humans perceive a face. This difference in repre- sentation makes it basically impossible for a human to come up with a good set of rules to describe what constitutes a face in a digital image.

{"text": "pandas is a Python library for data wrangling and analysis. It is built around a data structure called the DataFrame that is modeled after the R DataFrame. Simply put, a pandas DataFrame is a table, similar to an Excel spreadsheet. pandas provides a great range of methods to modify and operate on this table; in particular, it allows SQL-like queries and joins of tables. In contrast to NumPy, which requires that all entries in an array be of the same type, pandas allows each column to have a separate type (for example, integers, dates, floating-point numbers, and strings). Another valuable tool provided by pandas is its ability to ingest from a great variety of file formats and data- bases, like SQL, Excel files, and comma-separated values (CSV) files. Going into detail about the functionality of pandas is out of the scope of this book. However, Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney (O'Reilly, 2012) provides a great guide.

It is usually a good idea to use stratified k -fold cross-validation instead of k -fold cross-validation to evaluate a classifier, because it results in more reliable estimates of generalization performance. In the case of only 10% of samples belonging to class B, using standard k -fold cross-validation it might easily happen that one fold only con- tains samples of class A. Using this fold as a test set would not be very informative about the overall performance of the classifier.

{"text": "There are two major versions of Python that are widely used at the moment: Python 2 (more precisely, 2.7) and Python 3 (with the latest release being 3.5 at the time of writing). This sometimes leads to some confusion. Python 2 is no longer actively developed, but because Python 3 contains major changes, Python 2 code usually does not run on Python 3. If you are new to Python, or are starting a new project from scratch, we highly recommend using the latest version of Python 3 without changes. If you have a large codebase that you rely on that is written for Python 2, you are excused from upgrading for now. However, you should try to migrate to Python 3 as soon as possible. When writing any new code, it is for the most part quite easy to write code that runs under Python 2 and Python 3. 2 If you don't have to interface with legacy software, you should definitely use Python 3.

This clearly cannot be right, as our data is entirely random. What happened here is that our feature selection picked out some features among the 10,000 random features that are (by chance) very well correlated with the target. Because we fit the feature selection outside of the cross-validation, it could find features that are correlated both on the training and the test folds. The information we leaked from the test folds was very informative, leading to highly unrealistic results. Let's compare this to a proper cross-validation using a pipeline: As you can see, possibly a bit surprisingly, the first 10 entries in the vocabulary are all numbers.

It does not find single-letter words, and it splits up contractions like \"doesn't\" or \"bit.ly\", but it matches \"h8ter\" as a single word.

One way to cut back on these is to only use tokens that appear in at least two documents (or at least five documents, and so on).

{"text": "From the plots, we can see that the three classes seem to be relatively well separated using the sepal and petal measurements. This means that a machine learning model will likely be able to learn to separate them. As we can see from the plot, using only a single neighbor, each point in the training set has an obvious influence on the predictions, and the predicted values go through all of the data points. This leads to a very unsteady prediction. Considering more neighbors leads to smoother predictions, but these do not fit the training data as well. A common task in face recognition is to ask if a previously unseen face belongs to a known person from a database. This has applications in photo collection, social media, and security applications. One way to solve this problem would be to build a classifier where each person is a separate class. However, there are usually many dif- ferent people in face databases, and very few images of the same person (i.e., very few training examples per class). That makes it hard to train most classifiers. Additionally, you often want to be able to add new people easily, without needing to retrain a large model.

In this chapter, we discussed how to deal with different data types (in particular, with categorical variables). We emphasized the importance of representing data in a way that is suitable for the machine learning algorithm\u2014for example, by one-hotencoding categorical variables. We also discussed the importance of engineering new features, and the possibility of utilizing expert knowledge in creating derived features from your data. In particular, linear models might benefit greatly from generating new features via binning and adding polynomials and interactions, while more com- plex, nonlinear models like random forests and SVMs might be able to learn more complex tasks without explicitly expanding the feature space. In practice, the features that are used (and the match between features and method) is often the most impor- tant piece in making a machine learning approach work well. Now that you have a good idea of how to represent your data in an appropriate way and which algorithm to use for which task, the next chapter will focus on evaluating the performance of machine learning models and selecting the right parameter settings.

In this chapter we discussed cross-validation, grid search, and evaluation metrics, the cornerstones of evaluating and improving machine learning algorithms. The tools described in this chapter, together with the algorithms described in Chapters 2 and 3, are the bread and butter of every machine learning practitioner. There are two particular points that we made in this chapter that warrant repeating, because they are often overlooked by new practitioners. The first has to do with cross-validation. Cross-validation or the use of a test set allow us to evaluate a machine learning model as it will perform in the future. However, if we use the test set or cross-validation to select a model or select model parameters, we \"use up\" the test data, and using the same data to evaluate how well our model will do in the future will lead to overly optimistic estimates. We therefore need to resort to a split into training data for model building, validation data for model and parameter selection, and test data for model evaluation. Instead of a simple split, we can replace each of these splits with cross-validation. The most commonly used form (as described ear- lier) is a training/test split for evaluation, and using cross-validation on the training set for model and parameter selection.

The second point has to do with the importance of the evaluation metric or scoring function used for model selection and model evaluation. The theory of how to make business decisions from the predictions of a machine learning model is somewhat beyond the scope of this book. 7 However, it is rarely the case that the end goal of a machine learning task is building a model with a high accuracy. Make sure that the metric you choose to evaluate and select a model for is a good stand-in for what the model will actually be used for. In reality, classification problems rarely have balanced classes, and often false positives and false negatives have very different consequences.

The theory of how to make business decisions from the predictions of a machine learning model is somewhat beyond the scope of this book. 7 However, it is rarely the case that the end goal of a machine learning task is building a model with a high accuracy. Make sure that the metric you choose to evaluate and select a model for is a good stand-in for what the model will actually be used for. In reality, classification problems rarely have balanced classes, and often false positives and false negatives have very different consequences. Make sure you understand what these consequences are, and pick an evaluation met- ric accordingly.

The model evaluation and selection techniques we have described so far are the most important tools in a data scientist's toolbox. Grid search and cross-validation as we've described them in this chapter can only be applied to a single supervised model. We have seen before, however, that many models require preprocessing, and that in some applications, like the face recognition example in Chapter 3 , extracting a different representation of the data can be useful. In the next chapter, we will introduce the Pipeline class, which allows us to use grid search and cross-validation on these com- plex chains of algorithms.

In this chapter we introduced the Pipeline class, a general-purpose tool to chain together multiple processing steps in a machine learning workflow. Real-world appli- cations of machine learning rarely involve an isolated use of a model, and instead are a sequence of processing steps. Using pipelines allows us to encapsulate multiple steps into a single Python object that adheres to the familiar scikit-learn interface of fit, predict, and transform. In particular when doing model evaluation using crossvalidation and parameter selection using grid search, using the Pipeline class to cap- ture all the processing steps is essential for proper evaluation. The Pipeline class also allows writing more succinct code, and reduces the likelihood of mistakes that can happen when building processing chains without the pipeline class (like forgetting to apply all transformers on the test set, or not applying them in the right order). Choosing the right combination of feature extraction, preprocessing, and models is somewhat of an art, and often requires some trial and error. However, using pipe- lines, this \"trying out\" of many different processing steps is quite simple. When experimenting, be careful not to overcomplicate your processes, and make sure to evaluate whether every component you are including in your model is necessary.

In the next chapter, we will dive in more detail into one particular type of data that is commonly seen in practice, and that requires some special expertise to handle correctly: text data. In this chapter we talked about the basics of processing text, also known as natural language processing (NLP), with an example application classifying movie reviews. The tools discussed here should serve as a great starting point when trying to process text data. In particular for text classification tasks such as spam and fraud detection or sentiment analysis, bag-of-words representations provide a simple and powerful solution. As is often the case in machine learning, the representation of the data is key in NLP applications, and inspecting the tokens and n -grams that are extracted can give powerful insights into the modeling process. In text-processing applications, it is often possible to introspect models in a meaningful way, as we saw in this chapter, for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. You should take full advantage of this ability when using NLP-based methods in practice. Natural language and text processing is a large research field, and discussing the details of advanced methods is far beyond the scope of this book. If you want to learn more, we recommend the O'Reilly book Natural Language Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, which provides an overview of NLP together with an introduction to the nltk Python package for NLP. Another great and more conceptual book is the standard reference Introduction to Information Retrieval by Christopher Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Sch\u00fctze, which describes fundamental algorithms in information retrieval, NLP, and machine learning. Both books have online versions that can be accessed free of charge. As we discussed ear- lier, the classes CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer only implement relatively simple text-processing methods. For more advanced text-processing methods, we recommend the Python packages spacy (a relatively new but very efficient and welldesigned package), nltk (a very well-established and complete but somewhat dated library), and gensim (an NLP package with an emphasis on topic modeling).

Predicting a person's annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task. When predicting income, the predicted value is an amount , and can be any number in a given range.

There are many possible rules we could come up with that would explain perfectly if someone in this dataset wants to buy a boat. No age appears twice in the data, so we could say people who are 66, 52, 53, or 58 years old want to buy a boat, while all others don't. While we can make up many rules that work well on this data, remember that we are not interested in making pre- dictions for this dataset; we already know the answers for these customers. We want to know if new customers are likely to buy a boat. We therefore want to find a rule that will work well for new customers, and achieving 100 percent accuracy on the training set does not help us there. We might not expect that the rule our data scientist came up with will work very well on new customers. It seems too complex, and it is sup- ported by very little data. For example, the \"or is not divorced\" part of the rule hinges on a single customer. After looking at the data for a while, our novice data scientist comes up with the fol- lowing rule: \"If the customer is older than 45, and has less than 3 children or is not divorced, then they want to buy a boat.\" When asked how well this rule of his does, our data scientist answers, \"It's 100 percent accurate!\" And indeed, on the data that is in the table, the rule is perfectly accurate.

For example, the \"or is not divorced\" part of the rule hinges on a single customer. The only measure of whether an algorithm will perform well on new data is the eval- uation on the test set. However, intuitively 3 we expect simple models to generalize better to new data. If the rule was \"People older than 50 want to buy a boat,\" and this would explain the behavior of all the customers, we would trust it more than the rule involving children and marital status in addition to age. Therefore, we always want to find the simplest model. Building a model that is too complex for the amount of information we have, as our novice data scientist did, is called overfitting . Overfitting occurs when you fit a model too closely to the particularities of the training set and obtain a model that works well on the training set but is not able to generalize to new data. On the other hand, if your model is too simple\u2014say, \"Everybody who owns a house buys a boat\"\u2014then you might not be able to capture all the aspects of and vari- ability in the data, and your model will do badly even on the training set.

Choosing too simple a model is called underfitting . The more complex we allow our model to be, the better we will be able to predict on the training data. However, if our model becomes too complex, we start focusing too much on each individual data point in our training set, and the model will not gener- alize well to new data. The only measure of whether an algorithm will perform well on new data is the eval- uation on the test set. However, intuitively 3 we expect simple models to generalize better to new data. If the rule was \"People older than 50 want to buy a boat,\" and this would explain the behavior of all the customers, we would trust it more than the rule involving children and marital status in addition to age. Therefore, we always want to find the simplest model. Building a model that is too complex for the amount of information we have, as our novice data scientist did, is called overfitting .

For more classes, we count how many neighbors belong to each class and again predict the most common class. Now let's look at how we can apply the k -nearest neighbors algorithm using scikitlearn. First, we split our data into a training and a test set so we can evaluate general- ization performance, as discussed in Chapter 1: As you know, linear models can only model linear relationships, which are lines in the case of a single feature. The decision tree can build a much more complex model of the data. However, this is strongly dependent on the representation of the data. One way to make linear models more powerful on continuous data is to use binning (also known as discretization ) of the feature to split it up into multiple features, as described here. We imagine a partition of the input range for the feature (in this case, the numbers from \u20133 to 3) into a fixed number of bins \u2014say, 10. A data point will then be repre- sented by which bin it falls into. To determine this, we first have to define the bins. In this case, we'll define 10 bins equally spaced between \u20133 and 3. We use the np.linspace function for this, creating 11 entries, which will create 10 bins\u2014they are the spaces in between two consecutive boundaries: As you know, linear models can only model linear relationships, which are lines in the case of a single feature.

We will now do the following. First, select the most informative of the 10 features using SelectPercentile feature selection, and then we evaluate a Ridge regressor using cross-validation: Out[11]: We can see that the word counts for each word are either 0 or 1; neither of the two strings in bards_words contains a word twice.

The first string (\"The fool doth think he is wise,\") is repre- sented as the first row in, and it contains the first word in the vocabulary, \"be\", zero times. It also contains the second word in the vocabulary, \"but\", zero times. It con- tains the third word, \"doth\", once, and so on.

{"text": "The plot shows the training and test set accuracy on the y-axis against the setting of n_neighbors on the x-axis. While real-world plots are rarely very smooth, we can still recognize some of the characteristics of overfitting and underfitting (note that because considering fewer neighbors corresponds to a more complex model, the plot is horizontally flipped relative to the illustration in Figure 2-1 ). Considering a single nearest neighbor, the prediction on the training set is perfect. But when more neigh- bors are considered, the model becomes simpler and the training accuracy drops. The test set accuracy for using a single neighbor is lower than when using more neigh- bors, indicating that using the single nearest neighbor leads to a model that is too complex. On the other hand, when considering 10 neighbors, the model is too simple and performance is even worse. The best performance is somewhere in the middle, using around six neighbors. Still, it is good to keep the scale of the plot in mind. The worst performance is around 88% accuracy, which might still be acceptable. print (\"PCA component shape: {}\".format(pca.components_.shape)) In this example, the model learned an offset for each bin, together with a slope.

Large values for alpha or small values for C mean simple models. In particular for the regression mod- els, tuning these parameters is quite important.

MultinomialNB usually performs better than BinaryNB, particularly on datasets with a relatively large number of nonzero features (i.e., large documents). The naive Bayes models share many of the strengths and weaknesses of the linear models. They are very fast to train and to predict, and the training procedure is easy to understand. The models work very well with high-dimensional sparse data and are relatively robust to the parameters. Naive Bayes models are great baseline models and are often used on very large datasets, where training even a linear model might take too long. As discussed earlier, the parameters that control model complexity in decision trees are the pre-pruning parameters that stop the building of the tree before it is fully developed. Usually, picking one of the pre-pruning strategies\u2014setting either max_depth, max_leaf_nodes, or min_samples_leaf\u2014is sufficient to prevent overfit- ting.

Decision trees have two advantages over many of the algorithms we've discussed so far: the resulting model can easily be visualized and understood by nonexperts (at least for smaller trees), and the algorithms are completely invariant to scaling of the data. As each feature is processed separately, and the possible splits of the data don't depend on scaling, no preprocessing like normalization or standardization of features is needed for decision tree algorithms.

Kernelized support vector machines are powerful models and perform well on a vari- ety of datasets. SVMs allow for complex decision boundaries, even if the data has only a few features. They work well on low-dimensional and high-dimensional data (i.e., few and many features), but don't scale very well with the number of samples. Run- ning an SVM on data with up to 10,000 samples might work well, but working with datasets of size 100,000 or more can become challenging in terms of runtime and memory usage. Another downside of SVMs is that they require careful preprocessing of the data and tuning of the parameters. This is why, these days, most people instead use tree-based models such as random forests or gradient boosting (which require little or no pre- processing) in many applications. Furthermore, SVM models are hard to inspect; it can be difficult to understand why a particular prediction was made, and it might be tricky to explain the model to a nonexpert.

The important parameters in kernel SVMs are the regularization parameter C, the choice of the kernel, and the kernel-specific parameters. Although we primarily focused on the RBF kernel, other choices are available in scikit-learn. The RBF kernel has only one parameter, gamma, which is the inverse of the width of the Gaus- sian kernel. gamma and C both control the complexity of the model, with large values in either resulting in a more complex model. Therefore, good settings for the two parameters are usually strongly correlated, and C and gamma should be adjusted together.

Neural networks have reemerged as state-of-the-art models in many applications of machine learning.

This is confirmed in the plot in Figure 2-12 : {\"table\": {\"columns\": [\"Number of feature appearances:\", \"[28 38 68 48 61 59 45 56 37 40 35 34 36 26 23 26 27 21 23 23 18 21 10 9 17\", \"9 7 14 12 7 3 8 4 5 5 3 4 2 4 1 1 3 2 5 3 8 2 5 2 1\"], \"rows\": [[\"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\", \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\", \"1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]\"]]}} The value 2 seems to be the most common, with 62 appearances (bincount always starts at 0), and the counts for higher values fall quickly. However, there are some very high values, like 134 appearing twice. We visualize the counts in Figure 4-7:"}

Let's try to fit a ridge regression to this model: Now we can define the parameter_grid to search over. We want the classifier to be either RandomForestClassifier or SVC. Because they have different parameters to tune, and need different preprocessing, we can make use of the list of search grids we discussed in \"Search over spaces that are not grids\" on page 271. To assign an estima- tor to a step, we use the name of the step as the parameter name.

In other words, when you use a high value for the parameter C, Logis ticRegression and LinearSVC try to fit the training set as best as possible, while with low values of the parameter C, the models put more emphasis on finding a coefficient vector ( w ) that is close to zero.

In most real-world cases, applying feature selection is unlikely to provide large gains in performance. However, it is still a valuable tool in the toolbox of the feature engineer.

Picking which class is declared the positive class has a big impact on the metrics. While the f -score for the dummy classification is 0.13 (vs. 0.89 for the logistic regression) on the \"nine\" class, for the \"not nine\" class it is 0.90 vs. 0.99, which both seem like reasonable results. Looking at all the numbers together paints a pretty accurate picture, though, and we can clearly see the superiority of the logistic regression model. {\"table\": {\"columns\": [\"topic 53\", \"topic 54\", \"topic 63\"], \"rows\": [[\"topic 97\", \"--------\", \"--------\"], [\"--------\", \"--------\", \"scott\"], [\"funny\", \"dead\", \"didn\"], [\"budget\", \"comedy\", \"zombie\"], [\"streisand\", \"actors\", \"laugh\"], [\"wasn\", \"star\", \"low\"], [\"zombies\", \"ending\", \"hart\"], [\"humor\", \"blood\", \"minutes\"], [\"waste\", \"hilarious\", \"horror\"], [\"dolph\", \"10\", \"laughs\"], [\"felt\", \"career\", \"give\"], [\"minutes\", \"part\", \"sabrina\"], [\"re\", \"body\", \"going\"], [\"nothing\", \"funniest\", \"living\"], [\"temple\", \"terrible\", \"laughing\"], [\"bit\", \"phantom\", \"crap\"], [\"flick\", \"found\", \"judy\"], [\"few\", \"budget\", \"though\"], [\"reviews\", \"moments\", \"head\"], [\"zorro\", \"imdb\", \"guy\"], [\"lot\", \"gets\", \"director\"], [\"evil\", \"saw\", \"barbra\"], [\"times\", \"shot\", \"long\"], [\"believe\", \"laughed\", \"low\"], [\"short\", \"am\", \"comedies\"], [\"few\", \"serial\", \"actually\"]]}} The topics we extracted this time seem to be more specific, though many are hard to interpret. Topic 7 seems to be about horror movies and thrillers; topics 16 and 54 seem to capture bad reviews, while topic 63 mostly seems to be capturing positive reviews of comedies. If we want to make further inferences using the topics that were discovered, we should confirm the intuition we gained from looking at the highestranking words for each topic by looking at the documents that are assigned to these topics. For example, topic 45 seems to be about music. Let's check which kinds of reviews are assigned to this topic:"}

{"text": "Here, we have four data points, with four binary features each. There are two classes, 0 and 1. For class 0 (the first and third data points), the first feature is zero two times and nonzero zero times, the second feature is zero one time and nonzero one time, and so on. These same counts are then calculated for the data points in the second class. Counting the nonzero entries per class in essence looks like this: One might have expected the dense region in the lower left to be the first cluster, the dense region in the upper right to be the second, and the less dense region in the cen- ter to be the third. Instead, both cluster 0 and cluster 1 have some points that are far away from all the other points in these clusters that \"reach\" toward the center. k -means also assumes that all directions are equally important for each cluster. The following plot ( Figure 3-28 ) shows a two-dimensional dataset where there are three clearly separated parts in the data. However, these groups are stretched toward the diagonal.

{"text": "Typically, building a tree as described here and continuing until all leaves are pure leads to models that are very complex and highly overfit to the training data.

This line provides quite a good forecast for the test data (the years after 2000), while glossing over some of the finer variations in both the training and the test data. The tree model, on the other hand, makes perfect predictions on the training data; we did not restrict the complexity of the tree, so it learned the whole dataset by heart. However, once we leave the data range for which the model has data, the model simply keeps predicting the last known point. The tree has no ability to generate \"new\" responses, outside of what was seen in the training data. This shortcoming applies to all models based on trees. 9"}

{"text": "As we just observed, a main drawback of decision trees is that they tend to overfit the training data. Random forests are one way to address this problem. A random forest is essentially a collection of decision trees, where each tree is slightly different from the others. The idea behind random forests is that each tree might do a relatively good job of predicting, but will likely overfit on part of the data. If we build many trees, all of which work well and overfit in different ways, we can reduce the amount of overfitting by averaging their results. This reduction in overfitting, while retaining the predictive power of the trees, can be shown using rigorous mathematics. To implement this strategy, we need to build many decision trees. Each tree should do an acceptable job of predicting the target, and should also be different from the other trees. Random forests get their name from injecting randomness into the tree build- ing to ensure each tree is different. There are two ways in which the trees in a random forest are randomized: by selecting the data points used to build a tree and by select- ing the features in each split test.

This reduction in overfitting, while retaining the predictive power of the trees, can be shown using rigorous mathematics. To implement this strategy, we need to build many decision trees. Each tree should do an acceptable job of predicting the target, and should also be different from the other trees. Random forests get their name from injecting randomness into the tree build- ing to ensure each tree is different. There are two ways in which the trees in a random forest are randomized: by selecting the data points used to build a tree and by select- ing the features in each split test. Let's go into this process in more detail. Building random forests. To build a random forest model, you need to decide on the number of trees to build (the n_estimators parameter of RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier). Let's say we want to build 10 trees. These trees will be built completely independently from each other, and the algorithm will make differ- ent random choices for each tree to make sure the trees are distinct. To build a tree, we first take what is called a bootstrap sample of our data. That is, from our n_samples data points, we repeatedly draw an example randomly with replacement (meaning the same sample can be picked multiple times), n_samples times. This will create a data- set that is as big as the original dataset, but some data points will be missing from it (approximately one third), and some will be repeated.

Next, a decision tree is built based on this newly created dataset. However, the algo- rithm we described for the decision tree is slightly modified. Instead of looking for the best test for each node, in each node the algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features, and it looks for the best possible test involving one of these features. The number of features that are selected is controlled by the max_features parameter. This selection of a subset of features is repeated separately in each node, so that each node in a tree can make a decision using a different subset of the features. Building random forests.

If we set max_features to n_fea tures, that means that each split can look at all features in the dataset, and no ran- domness will be injected in the feature selection (the randomness due to the bootstrapping remains, though). If we set max_features to 1, that means that the splits have no choice at all on which feature to test, and can only search over different thresholds for the feature that was selected randomly. Therefore, a high max_fea tures means that the trees in the random forest will be quite similar, and they will be able to fit the data easily, using the most distinctive features. A low max_features means that the trees in the random forest will be quite different, and that each tree might need to be very deep in order to fit the data well.

A sensible approach would be to extract all the faces and divide them into groups of faces that look similar. Hopefully, these correspond to the same person, and the images can be grouped together for you."}

{"text": "While we certainly cannot understand all aspects of these components, we can guess which aspects of the face images some of the components are capturing. The first component seems to mostly encode the contrast between the face and the back- ground, the second component encodes differences in lighting between the right and the left half of the face, and so on. While this representation is slightly more semantic than the raw pixel values, it is still quite far from how a human might perceive a face. As the PCA model is based on pixels, the alignment of the face (the position of eyes, chin, and nose) and the lighting both have a strong influence on how similar two images are in their pixel representation. But alignment and lighting are probably not what a human would perceive first. When asking people to rate similarity of faces, they are more likely to use attributes like age, gender, facial expression, and hair style, which are attributes that are hard to infer from the pixel intensities. It's important to keep in mind that algorithms often interpret data (particularly visual data, such as images, which humans are very familiar with) quite differently from how a human would. Let's come back to the specific case of PCA, though. We introduced the PCA transfor- mation as rotating the data and then dropping the components with low variance. Another useful interpretation is to try to find some numbers (the new feature values after the PCA rotation) so that we can express the test points as a weighted sum of the principal components (see Figure 3-10). While we certainly cannot understand all aspects of these components, we can guess which aspects of the face images some of the components are capturing. The first component seems to mostly encode the contrast between the face and the back- ground, the second component encodes differences in lighting between the right and the left half of the face, and so on. While this representation is slightly more semantic than the raw pixel values, it is still quite far from how a human might perceive a face.

Another way we can try to understand what a PCA model is doing is by looking at the reconstructions of the original data using only some components. In Figure 3-3, after dropping the second component and arriving at the third panel, we undid the rotation and added the mean back to obtain new points in the original space with the second component removed, as shown in the last panel.

The idea behind t-SNE is to find a two-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the distances between points as best as possible. t-SNE starts with a random twodimensional representation for each data point, and then tries to make points that are close in the original feature space closer, and points that are far apart in the original feature space farther apart. t-SNE puts more emphasis on points that are close by, rather than preserving distances between far-apart points.

This means these algorithms cannot be applied to a test set: rather, they can only transform the data they were trained for. Manifold learning can be useful for explora- tory data analysis, but is rarely used if the final goal is supervised learning. The idea behind t-SNE is to find a two-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the distances between points as best as possible. t-SNE starts with a random twodimensional representation for each data point, and then tries to make points that are close in the original feature space closer, and points that are far apart in the original feature space farther apart. t-SNE puts more emphasis on points that are close by, rather than preserving distances between far-apart points. In other words, it tries to preserve the information indicating which points are neighbors to each other. We will apply the t-SNE manifold learning algorithm on a dataset of handwritten dig- its that is included in scikit-learn. 2 Each data point in this dataset is an 8\u00d78 gray- scale image of a handwritten digit between 0 and 1.

{"text": "As we described earlier, clustering is the task of partitioning the dataset into groups, called clusters. The goal is to split up the data in such a way that points within a single cluster are very similar and points in different clusters are different.

{"text": "By far the most common way to represent categorical variables is using the one-hot encoding or one-out-of-N encoding , also known as dummy variables . The idea behind dummy variables is to replace a categorical variable with one or more new features that can have the values 0 and 1. The values 0 and 1 make sense in the formula for linear binary classification (and for all other models in scikit-learn), and we can represent any number of categories by introducing one new feature per category, as described here. Let's say for the workclass feature we have possible values of \"Government Employee\", \"Private Employee\", \"Self Employed\", and \"Self Employed Incorpo rated\". To encode these four possible values, we create four new features, called \"Gov ernment Employee\", \"Private Employee\", \"Self Employed\", and \"Self Employed Incorporated\". A feature is 1 if workclass for this person has the corresponding value and 0 otherwise, so exactly one of the four new features will be 1 for each data point.

This can lead to simpler models that generalize better. But how can you know how good each feature is? There are three basic strategies: univariate statistics , model-based selection , and iterative selection . We will discuss all three of them in detail.

{"text": "In univariate testing we used no model, while in model-based selection we used a sin- gle model to select features. In iterative feature selection, a series of models are built, with varying numbers of features. There are two basic methods: starting with no fea- tures and adding features one by one until some stopping criterion is reached, or starting with all features and removing features one by one until some stopping crite- rion is reached. Because a series of models are built, these methods are much more computationally expensive than the methods we discussed previously. One particular method of this kind is recursive feature elimination (RFE), which starts with all fea- tures, builds a model, and discards the least important feature according to the model. Then a new model is built using all but the discarded feature, and so on until only a prespecified number of features are left. For this to work, the model used for selection needs to provide some way to determine feature importance, as was the case for the model-based selection. Here, we use the same random forest model that we used earlier, and get the results shown in Figure 4-11 :"}

When performing five-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into five parts of (approximately) equal size, called folds . Next, a sequence of models is trained. The first model is trained using the first fold as the test set, and the remaining folds (2\u20135) are used as the training set. The model is built using the data in folds 2\u20135, and then the accuracy is evaluated on fold 1. Then another model is built, this time using fold 2 as the test set and the data in folds 1, 3, 4, and 5 as the training set. This process is repeated using folds 3, 4, and 5 as test sets.

For most use cases, the defaults of k -fold crossvalidation for regression and stratified k -fold for classification work well, but there are some cases where you might want to use a different strategy. Say, for example, we want to use the standard k -fold cross-validation on a classification dataset to repro- duce someone else's results. To do this, we first have to import the KFold splitter class from the model_selection module and instantiate it with the number of folds we want to use:"}

In shuffle-split cross-validation, each split samples train_size many points for the training set and test_size many (disjoint) point for the test set. This splitting is repeated n_iter times. Figure 5-3 illustrates running four iterations of splitting a dataset consisting of 10 points, with a training set of 5 points and test sets of 2 points each (you can use integers for train_size and test_size to use absolute sizes for these sets, or floating-point numbers to use fractions of the whole dataset):"}

The goal is to build a classifier that can correctly identify emotions of people not in the dataset. You could use the default stratified cross-validation to measure the performance of a classifier here.

It will be much easier for a classifier to detect emotions in a face that is part of the training set, compared to a completely new face.

However, there are still a number of caveats in evaluating even this simple task. Before we dive into alternative metrics, let's have a look at the ways in which measuring accuracy might be misleading. Remember that for binary classification, we often speak of a positive class and a negative class, with the understanding that the positive class is the one we are looking for."}

One of the most common ways to do this is using the term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (tf\u2013idf) method. The intuition of this method is to give high weight to any term that appears often in a particular document, but not in many documents in the corpus. If a word appears often in a particular document, but not in very many documents, it is likely to be very descriptive of the content of that document. scikit-learn implements the tf\u2013idf method in two classes: TfidfTransformer, which takes in the sparse matrix output produced by CountVectorizer and transforms it, and TfidfVectorizer, which takes in the text data and does both the bag-of-words feature extraction and the tf\u2013idf transformation. There are several variants of the tf\u2013idf rescaling scheme, which you can read about on Wikipedia . The tf\u2013idf score for word w in document d as implemented in both the TfidfTransformer and TfidfVectorizer classes is given by: 7 where N is the number of documents in the training set, N w is the number of docu- ments in the training set that the word w appears in, and tf (the term frequency) is the number of times that the word w appears in the query document d (the document you want to transform or encode). Both classes also apply L2 normalization after computing the tf\u2013idf representation; in other words, they rescale the representation of each document to have Euclidean norm 1.

The tf\u2013idf score for word w in document d as implemented in both the TfidfTransformer and TfidfVectorizer classes is given by: 7 where N is the number of documents in the training set, N w is the number of docu- ments in the training set that the word w appears in, and tf (the term frequency) is the number of times that the word w appears in the query document d (the document you want to transform or encode). Both classes also apply L2 normalization after computing the tf\u2013idf representation; in other words, they rescale the representation of each document to have Euclidean norm 1. Rescaling in this way means that the length of a document (the number of words) does not change the vectorized repre- sentation. Because tf\u2013idf actually makes use of the statistical properties of the training data, we will use a pipeline, as described in Chapter 6, to ensure the results of our grid search are valid. This leads to the following code: where N is the number of documents in the training set, N w is the number of docu- ments in the training set that the word w appears in, and tf (the term frequency) is the number of times that the word w appears in the query document d (the document you want to transform or encode).

{"text": "One of the main disadvantages of using a bag-of-words representation is that word order is completely discarded. Therefore, the two strings \"it's bad, not good at all\" and \"it's good, not bad at all\" have exactly the same representation, even though the mean- ings are inverted. Putting \"not\" in front of a word is only one example (if an extreme one) of how context matters. Fortunately, there is a way of capturing context when using a bag-of-words representation, by not only considering the counts of single tokens, but also the counts of pairs or triplets of tokens that appear next to each other. Pairs of tokens are known as bigrams , triplets of tokens are known as trigrams , and more generally sequences of tokens are known as n-grams . We can change the range of tokens that are considered as features by changing the ngram_range parameter of CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer.

{"text": "You should also consider if and how you should have humans in the loop. Some pro- cesses (like pedestrian detection in a self-driving car) need to make immediate deci- sions. Others might not need immediate responses, and so it can be possible to have humans confirm uncertain decisions. Medical applications, for example, might need very high levels of precision that possibly cannot be achieved by a machine learning algorithm alone. But if an algorithm can make 90 percent, 50 percent, or maybe even just 10 percent of decisions automatically, that might already increase response time or reduce cost. Many applications are dominated by \"simple cases,\" for which an algo- rithm can make a decision, with relatively few \"complicated cases,\" which can be rerouted to a human."}
{"text": "The tools we've discussed in this book are great for many machine learning applica- tions, and allow very quick analysis and prototyping. Python and scikit-learn are also used in production systems in many organizations\u2014even very large ones like international banks and global social media companies. However, many companies have complex infrastructure, and it is not always easy to include Python in these sys- tems. That is not necessarily a problem. In many companies, the data analytics teams work with languages like Python and R that allow the quick testing of ideas, while production teams work with languages like Go, Scala, C++, and Java to build robust, scalable systems. Data analysis has different requirements from building live services, and so using different languages for these tasks makes sense. A relatively common solution is to reimplement the solution that was found by the analytics team inside the larger framework, using a high-performance language. This can be easier than embedding a whole library or programming language and converting from and to the different data formats. Regardless of whether you can use scikit-learn in a production system or not, it is important to keep in mind that production systems have different requirements from one-off analysis scripts. If an algorithm is deployed into a larger system, software engineering aspects like reliability, predictability, runtime, and memory requirements gain relevance. Simplicity is key in providing machine learning systems that perform well in these areas. Critically inspect each part of your data processing and prediction pipeline and ask yourself how much complexity each step creates, how robust each component is to changes in the data or compute infrastructure, and if the benefit of each component warrants the complexity. If you are building involved machine learn- ing systems, we highly recommend reading the paper \"Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt\" , published by researchers in Google's machine learning team. The paper highlights the trade-off in creating and maintain- ing machine learning software in production at a large scale. While the issue of tech- nical debt is particularly pressing in large-scale and long-term projects, the lessons learned can help us build better software even for short-lived and smaller systems. The tools we've discussed in this book are great for many machine learning applica- tions, and allow very quick analysis and prototyping. Python and scikit-learn are also used in production systems in many organizations\u2014even very large ones like international banks and global social media companies. However, many companies have complex infrastructure, and it is not always easy to include Python in these sys- tems. That is not necessarily a problem. In many companies, the data analytics teams work with languages like Python and R that allow the quick testing of ideas, while production teams work with languages like Go, Scala, C++, and Java to build robust, scalable systems. Data analysis has different requirements from building live services, and so using different languages for these tasks makes sense. A relatively common solution is to reimplement the solution that was found by the analytics team inside the larger framework, using a high-performance language. This can be easier than embedding a whole library or programming language and converting from and to the different data formats. Regardless of whether you can use scikit-learn in a production system or not, it is important to keep in mind that production systems have different requirements from one-off analysis scripts. If an algorithm is deployed into a larger system, software engineering aspects like reliability, predictability, runtime, and memory requirements gain relevance. Simplicity is key in providing machine learning systems that perform well in these areas. Critically inspect each part of your data processing and prediction pipeline and ask yourself how much complexity each step creates, how robust each component is to changes in the data or compute infrastructure, and if the benefit of each component warrants the complexity. If you are building involved machine learn- ing systems, we highly recommend reading the paper \"Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt\" , published by researchers in Google's machine learning team. The paper highlights the trade-off in creating and maintain- ing machine learning software in production at a large scale. While the issue of tech- nical debt is particularly pressing in large-scale and long-term projects, the lessons learned can help us build better software even for short-lived and smaller systems."}

{"text": "Because this is an introductory book, we focused on the most common machine learning tasks: classification and regression in supervised learning, and clustering and signal decomposition in unsupervised learning. There are many more kinds of machine learning out there, with many important applications. There are two partic- ularly important topics that we did not cover in this book. The first is ranking , in which we want to retrieve answers to a particular query, ordered by their relevance. You've probably already used a ranking system today; this is how search engines operate. You input a search query and obtain a sorted list of answers, ranked by how relevant they are. A great introduction to ranking is provided in Manning, Raghavan, and Sch\u00fctze's book Introduction to Information Retrieval . The second topic is recom- mender systems , which provide suggestions to users based on their preferences. You've probably encountered recommender systems under headings like \"People You May Know,\" \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\" or \"Top Picks for You.\" There is plenty of literature on the topic, and if you want to dive right in you might be interested in the now classic \"Netflix prize challenge\", in which the Netflix video streaming site released a large dataset of movie preferences and offered a prize of $1 million to the team that could provide the best recommendations. Another common application is prediction of time series (like stock prices), which also has a whole body of literature devoted to it. There are many more machine learning tasks out there\u2014much more than we can list here\u2014and we encourage you to seek out information from books, research papers, and online communities to find the para- digms that best apply to your situation."}

The hellbender is also a key member of its ecosystem as prey: predators include various fish, snakes, and turtles. The hellbender salamander is a member of the giant salamander family, and can grow as large as 29 inches long. This is the third-largest aquatic salamander species in the world. Their bodies are rather flat, with thick folds of skin along their sides. While they do have a single gill on each side of the neck, hellbenders largely rely on their skin folds to breathe: gas flows in and out through capillaries near the surface of the skin. Because of this, their ideal habitat is in clear, fast-moving, shallow streams, which provide plenty of oxygen.

Its diet is made up of crayfish, small fish, and occasionally the eggs of its own species. The hellbender is also a key member of its ecosystem as prey: predators include various fish, snakes, and turtles. Hellbender salamander populations have decreased significantly in the last few deca- des. Water quality is the largest issue, as their respiratory system makes them very sensitive to polluted or murky water.

Water quality is the largest issue, as their respiratory system makes them very sensitive to polluted or murky water. An increase in agriculture and other human activity near their habitat means greater amounts of sediment and chemicals in the water. In an effort to save this endangered species, biologists have begun to raise the amphibians in captivity and release them when they reach a less vulnerable age.
