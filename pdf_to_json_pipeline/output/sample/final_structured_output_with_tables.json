Simply put, a pandas DataFrame is a table, similar to an Excel spreadsheet. pandas provides a great range of methods to modify and operate on this table; in particular, it allows SQL-like queries and joins of tables. In contrast to NumPy, which requires that all entries in an array be of the same type, pandas allows each column to have a separate type (for example, integers, dates, floating-point numbers, and strings). Another valuable tool provided by pandas is its ability to ingest from a great variety of file formats and data‐ bases, like SQL, Excel files, and comma-separated values (CSV) files. Going into detail about the functionality of pandas is out of the scope of this book. However, Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney (O'Reilly, 2012) provides a great guide.

If you're interested, you can look up all the functions in the repository, but the details of the mglearn module are not really important to the material in this book.

This sometimes leads to some confusion. Python 2 is no longer actively developed, but because Python 3 contains major changes, Python 2 code usually does not run on Python 3. If you are new to Python, or are starting a new project from scratch, we highly recommend using the latest version of Python 3 without changes. If you have a large codebase that you rely on that is written for Python 2, you are excused from upgrading for now. However, you should try to migrate to Python 3 as soon as possible. When writing any new code, it is for the most part quite easy to write code that runs under Python 2 and Python 3. 2 If you don't have to interface with legacy software, you should definitely use Python 3. All the code in this book is writ‐ ten in a way that works for both versions. However, the exact output might differ slightly under Python 2.",

Here, positive doesn't represent having benefit or value, but rather what the object of the study is. So, when looking for spam, \"positive\" could mean the spam class. Which of the two classes is called positive is often a subjective matter, and specific to the domain.",

Predicting a person's annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task. When predicting income, the predicted value is an amount , and can be any number in a given range. Another example of a regression task is predicting the yield of a corn farm given attributes such as previous yields, weather, and number of employees working on the farm.

While real-world plots are rarely very smooth, we can still recognize some of the characteristics of overfitting and underfitting (note that because considering fewer neighbors corresponds to a more complex model, the plot is horizontally flipped relative to the illustration in Figure 2-1 ). Considering a single nearest neighbor, the prediction on the training set is perfect. But when more neigh‐ bors are considered, the model becomes simpler and the training accuracy drops. The test set accuracy for using a single neighbor is lower than when using more neigh‐ bors, indicating that using the single nearest neighbor leads to a model that is too complex. On the other hand, when considering 10 neighbors, the model is too simple and performance is even worse. The best performance is somewhere in the middle, using around six neighbors. Still, it is good to keep the scale of the plot in mind. The worst performance is around 88% accuracy, which might still be acceptable.",

To reduce underfitting, let's try decreasing alpha. When we do this, we also need to increase the default setting of max_iter (the maximum num‐ ber of iterations to run):",

The tree model, on the other hand, makes perfect predictions on the training data; we did not restrict the complexity of the tree, so it learned the whole dataset by heart.

To build a random forest model, you need to decide on the number of trees to build (the n_estimators parameter of RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier). Let's say we want to build 10 trees. These trees will be built completely independently from each other, and the algorithm will make differ‐ ent random choices for each tree to make sure the trees are distinct. To build a tree, we first take what is called a bootstrap sample of our data. That is, from our n_samples data points, we repeatedly draw an example randomly with replacement (meaning the same sample can be picked multiple times), n_samples times. This will create a data‐ set that is as big as the original dataset, but some data points will be missing from it (approximately one third), and some will be repeated.",

Adding max_features or max_leaf_nodes might sometimes improve performance. It can also drastically reduce space and time requirements for training and prediction.",

This can be as small as 10 for very small or simple data‐ sets and as big as 10,000 for very complex data. It is also possible to add additional hidden layers, as shown in Figure 2-47 :",

But if we want to look at the Breast Cancer dataset, even using a pair plot is tricky. This dataset has 30 features, which would result in 30 * 14 = 420 scatter plots! We'd never be able to look at all these plots in detail, let alone try to understand them.",

This gives us some idea of how each feature is distributed across the two classes, and allows us to venture a guess as to which features are better at distinguishing malignant and benign samples. For example, the feature \"smooth‐ ness error\" seems quite uninformative, because the two histograms mostly overlap, while the feature \"worst concave points\" seems quite informative, because the histo‐ grams are quite disjoint."

When using a pixel representation to compare two images, we compare the grayscale value of each individual pixel to the value of the pixel in the corresponding position in the other image. This representa‐ tion is quite different from how humans would interpret the image of a face, and it is hard to capture the facial features using this raw representation. For example, using pixel distances means that shifting a face by one pixel to the right corresponds to a drastic change, with a completely different representation. We hope that using distan‐ ces along principal components can improve our accuracy. Here, we enable the whitening option of PCA, which rescales the principal components to have the same scale. This is the same as using StandardScaler after the transformation. Reusing the data from Figure 3-3 again, whitening corresponds to not only rotating the data, but also rescaling it so that the center panel is a circle instead of an ellipse (see Figure 3-8 ):"

    "text": "This is where PCA comes in. Computing distances in the original pixel space is quite a bad way to measure similarity between faces. When using a pixel representation to compare two images, we compare the grayscale value of each individual pixel to the value of the pixel in the corresponding position in the other image. This representa‐ tion is quite different from how humans would interpret the image of a face, and it is hard to capture the facial features using this raw representation.

You might remember that PCA tries to find directions of maximum variance in the data, while NMF tries to find additive components, which often correspond to \"extremes\" or \"parts\" of the data (see Figure 3-13 ). Both methods tried to express the data points as a sum over some components. k -means, on the other hand, tries to rep‐ resent each data point using a cluster center. You can think of that as each point being represented using only a single component, which is given by the cluster center. This view of k -means as a decomposition method, where each point is represented using a single component, is called vector quantization .",

We could set the number of clusters to the known number of people in the dataset, though it is very unlikely that an unsupervised clustering algorithm will recover them. Instead, we can start with a low number of clusters, like 10, which might allow us to analyze each of the clusters:",

When adding new features, or with high-dimensional datasets in general, it can be a good idea to reduce the number of features to only the most useful ones, and discard the rest. This can lead to simpler models that generalize better. But how can you know how good each feature is? There are three basic strategies: univariate statistics , model-based selection , and iterative selection . We will discuss all three of them in detail. All of these methods are supervised methods, meaning they need the target for fitting the model.

    "text": "In univariate testing we used no model, while in model-based selection we used a sin‐ gle model to select features. In iterative feature selection, a series of models are built, with varying numbers of features. There are two basic methods: starting with no fea‐ tures and adding features one by one until some stopping criterion is reached, or starting with all features and removing features one by one until some stopping crite‐ rion is reached. Because a series of models are built, these methods are much more computationally expensive than the methods we discussed previously. One particular method of this kind is recursive feature elimination (RFE), which starts with all fea‐ tures, builds a model, and discards the least important feature according to the model. Then a new model is built using all but the discarded feature, and so on until only a prespecified number of features are left. For this to work, the model used for selection needs to provide some way to determine feature importance, as was the case for the model-based selection. Here, we use the same random forest model that we used earlier, and get the results shown in Figure 4-11 :",

While the purpose of machine learning in many cases is to avoid hav‐ ing to create a set of expert-designed rules, that doesn't mean that prior knowledge of the application or domain should be discarded.

For example, flights are usually more expensive during peak vacation months and around holidays. While the dates of some holidays (like Christmas) are fixed, and their effect can therefore be learned from the date, others might depend on the phases of the moon (like Hanukkah and Easter) or be set by authorities (like school holi‐ days). These events cannot be learned from the data if each flight is only recorded using the (Gregorian) date. However, it is easy to add a feature that encodes whether a flight was on, preceding, or following a public or school holiday. In this way, prior knowledge about the nature of the task can be encoded in the features to aid a machine learning algorithm.

In crossvalidation, the data is instead split repeatedly and multiple models are trained. The most commonly used version of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation , where k is a user-specified number, usually 5 or 10. When performing five-fold cross-validation, the data is first partitioned into five parts of (approximately) equal size, called folds . Next, a sequence of models is trained. The first model is trained using the first fold as the test set, and the remaining folds (2–5) are used as the training set. The model is built using the data in folds 2–5, and then the accuracy is evaluated on fold 1. Then another model is built, this time using fold 2 as the test set and the data in folds 1, 3, 4, and 5 as the training set. This process is repeated using folds 3, 4, and 5 as test sets. For each of these five splits of the data into training and test sets, we compute the accuracy. In the end, we have collected five accuracy values. The process is illustrated in Figure 5-1:",

First, the parame‐ ters we adjusted are very important for obtaining good performance. Both parameters (C and gamma) matter a lot, as adjusting them can change the accuracy from 40% to 96%. Additionally, the ranges we picked for the parameters are ranges in which we see significant changes in the outcome. It's also important to note that the ranges for the parameters are large enough: the optimum values for each parameter are not on the edges of the plot.",
    "next_text": "The first panel shows no changes at all, with a constant color over the whole parame‐ ter grid. In this case, this is caused by improper scaling and range of the parameters C and gamma. However, if no change in accuracy is visible over the different parameter settings, it could also be that a parameter is just not important at all. It is usually good to try very extreme values first, to see if there are any changes in the accuracy as a result of changing a parameter."

If kernel='rbf', both the C and gamma parameters are used (but not other parameters like degree). In this case, searching over all possible combinations of C, gamma, and kernel wouldn't make sense: if kernel='linear', gamma is not used, and trying different values for gamma would be a waste of time. To deal with these kinds of \"conditional\" parameters, GridSearchCV allows the param_grid to be a list of dictionaries . Each dictionary in the list is expanded into an independent grid.

You can triv‐ ially obtain a perfect recall if you predict all samples to belong to the positive class there will be no false negatives, and no true negatives either. However, predicting all samples as positive will result in many false positives, and therefore the precision will be very low. On the other hand, if you find a model that predicts only the single data point it is most sure about as positive and the rest as negative, then precision will be perfect (assuming this data point is in fact positive), but recall will be very bad.",

Predicting randomly always produces an AUC of 0.5, no matter how imbalanced the classes in a dataset are. This makes AUC a much better metric for imbalanced classification problems than accuracy. The AUC can be interpreted as evaluating the ranking of positive samples. It's equivalent to the probability that a randomly picked point of the positive class will have a higher score according to the classifier than a randomly picked point from the negative class.

Luckily scikit-learn provides a very simple way to achieve this, via the scoring argument that can be used in both GridSearchCV and cross_val_score. You can simply provide a string describing the evaluation metric you want to use. Say, for example, we want to evalu‐ ate the SVM classifier on the \"nine vs. rest\" task on the digits dataset, using the AUC score.

However, if we use the test set or cross-validation to select a model or select model parameters, we \"use up\" the test data, and using the same data to evaluate how well our model will do in the future will lead to overly optimistic estimates. We therefore need to resort to a split into training data for model building, validation data for model and parameter selection, and test data for model evaluation.

Fortunately, there is a way of capturing context when using a bag-of-words representation, by not only considering the counts of single tokens, but also the counts of pairs or triplets of tokens that appear next to each other. Pairs of tokens are known as bigrams , triplets of tokens are known as trigrams , and more generally sequences of tokens are known as n-grams . We can change the range of tokens that are considered as features by changing the ngram_range parameter of CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. The ngram_range parameter is a tuple, con‐",

A good example for this is news data, which might be categorized into topics like \"politics,\" \"sports,\" \"finance,\" and so on. If each document is assigned a single topic, this is the task of clustering the documents, as discussed in Chapter 3. If each document can have more than one topic, the task",

Medical applications, for example, might need very high levels of precision that possibly cannot be achieved by a machine learning algorithm alone. But if an algorithm can make 90 percent, 50 percent, or maybe even just 10 percent of decisions automatically, that might already increase response time or reduce cost.

There are many more kinds of machine learning out there, with many important applications. There are two partic‐ ularly important topics that we did not cover in this book. The first is ranking , in which we want to retrieve answers to a particular query, ordered by their relevance. You've probably already used a ranking system today; this is how search engines operate. You input a search query and obtain a sorted list of answers, ranked by how relevant they are. A great introduction to ranking is provided in Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze's book Introduction to Information Retrieval . The second topic is recom‐ mender systems , which provide suggestions to users based on their preferences. You've probably encountered recommender systems under headings like \"People You May Know,\" \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\" or \"Top Picks for You.\" There is plenty of literature on the topic, and if you want to dive right in you might be interested in the now classic \"Netflix prize challenge\", in which the Netflix video streaming site released a large dataset of movie preferences and offered a prize of $1 million to the team that could provide the best recommendations. Another common application is prediction of time series (like stock prices), which also has a whole body of literature devoted to it. There are many more machine learning tasks out there—much more than we can list here—and we encourage you to seek out information from books, research papers, and online communities to find the para‐ digms that best apply to your situation.",
