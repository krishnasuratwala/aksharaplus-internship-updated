## Overview

This document provides a theoretical overview of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions about classification algorithms. The system integrates a custom knowledge base derived from Wikipedia with advanced natural language processing techniques. It employs a retriever (using Sentence-BERT and FAISS) to fetch relevant information and a generator (TinyLLaMA) to synthesize concise answers. Below, we explore the architecture, workflows, and key concepts such as embeddings and indexing, supported by detailed diagrams and examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objectives

-   Develop a structured knowledge base covering 108 machine learning topics from Wikipedia.
-   Design a RAG pipeline to retrieve contextually relevant content and generate accurate responses.
-   Explain critical technical components (embeddings and indexing) with theoretical depth and practical examples.

### Components

-   **User Query**: The input question posed by the user, seeking concise information about machine learning concepts.
-   **Retriever**:
    -   **Sentence-BERT**: Transforms text into 384-dimensional semantic embeddings for meaning-based comparison.
    -   **FAISS**: Indexes embeddings and performs similarity searches using Euclidean (L2) distance to retrieve top-K relevant chunks.
-   **Knowledge Base**: A preprocessed collection of 108 Wikipedia topics, stored as text chunks in a JSON structure, including metadata and mathematical content.
-   **Generator**: TinyLLaMA, a lightweight small language model (SLM) with 1.1 billion parameters, generates human-readable answers from retrieved context.
-   **Output**: The final answer, accompanied by retrieved chunks for transparency and validation.

### Workflow Steps

1.  **Load Knowledge Base**: Accesses a preprocessed dataset of 108 Wikipedia topics, segmented into chunks for retrieval.
2.  **Build Retriever**: Converts chunks into semantic embeddings and indexes them for efficient search.
3.  **Embed Question**: Transforms the user’s question into a vector representation.
4.  **Retrieve Top-K Chunks**: Identifies the K most relevant chunks based on vector similarity.
5.  **Generate Answer**: Uses the retrieved context to produce a concise answer via the SLM.
6.  **Output**: Delivers the answer and supporting chunks to the user.

## Knowledge Base Creation: Theoretical Framework

### Process Description

-   **Source**: Content is sourced from 108 Wikipedia pages covering machine learning topics (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
-   **Preprocessing**:
    -   **Text Cleaning**: Removes extraneous characters, retaining basic punctuation and mathematical formulas (e.g., LaTeX like `\( w^T x + b = 0 \)`).
    -   **Segmentation**: Splits text into sentences and further into chunks of 200–300 words to optimize retrieval granularity.
    -   **Mathematical Preservation**: Identifies and preserves formulas (e.g., `\[ \min \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 \]`) and key terms (e.g., `w`, `b`, `γ`) for technical accuracy.
-   **Storage**: Organizes data into a JSON structure with:
    -   **Metadata**: Includes topic title, URL, timestamp, and counts (e.g., sentences, formulas).
    -   **Content**: Stores cleaned text, sentence lists, chunked segments, and mathematical elements.

### Purpose

-   Provides a reliable, structured foundation of machine learning knowledge.
-   Ensures compatibility with retrieval systems by segmenting text into manageable units.
-   Maintains technical integrity by preserving mathematical content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RAG Pipeline: Theoretical Framework

### Retriever

-   **Semantic Embeddings**:
    -   **Concept**: Text is converted into 384-dimensional vectors that encode meaning, allowing semantic similarity comparisons.
    -   **Mechanism**: A transformer-based model processes text, leveraging contextual understanding to position similar meanings closer in vector space.
-   **Similarity Search**:
    -   **Concept**: An index organizes embeddings to enable rapid identification of the most relevant content.
    -   **Mechanism**: Uses Euclidean distance to measure vector proximity, retrieving the top-K closest matches.

### Generator

-   **Concept**: A small language model synthesizes a natural language response from retrieved context.
-   **Mechanism**: Combines the question and retrieved chunks into a prompt, then generates a concise answer using probabilistic text generation techniques.

### Workflow

1.  **Initialization**: Loads and indexes the knowledge base.
2.  **Retrieval**: Embeds the question and retrieves relevant chunks.
3.  **Generation**: Produces an answer based on the retrieved context.
4.  **Delivery**: Presents the answer with supporting evidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Embeddings and Indexing: Deep Dive

### Embeddings

-   **Definition**: Embeddings are high-dimensional vectors (384D in this case) that represent text in a way that captures its semantic meaning.
-   **How They Work**:
    -   Text is processed through a transformer model with 6 layers, which uses self-attention to understand word relationships.
    -   Output: A fixed-size vector (e.g., `[0.12, -0.34, ..., 0.89]`) where proximity in vector space indicates semantic similarity.
    -   Example: "Logistic regression" and "binary classification" yield vectors closer together than "logistic regression" and "car engine."
-   **Purpose**:
    -   Enables machines to compare text based on meaning rather than exact word matches.
    -   Forms the basis for retrieval by providing a numerical representation of content.

### Indexing

-   **Definition**: Indexing is the organization of embeddings into a searchable structure for efficient similarity retrieval.
-   **How It Works**:
    -   Embeddings are stored in a matrix, and an index computes distances between a query vector and all stored vectors.
    -   Uses **L2 Distance** (Euclidean): \[ d(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - b_i)^2} \] where smaller distances indicate higher similarity.
    -   Example: A Flat L2 index performs exact searches by calculating distances for all vectors, returning the top-K nearest.
-   **Purpose**:
    -   Reduces retrieval time from linear (O(n)) to near-constant time for small datasets, scalable with approximate methods for larger ones.
    -   Ensures relevant content is quickly identified.

### Integration

-   **Embedding → Indexing**: Text is embedded into vectors, then indexed for fast search.
-   **Search Process**: A question’s embedding is compared against the index to retrieve the most semantically similar chunks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Full Example

### Input

-   **Question**: "What is logistic regression, answer in short?"

### Knowledge Base Chunks

1.  **Chunk 1** (From Logistic_regression): "Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification. It uses the logistic function to model probabilities."
2.  **Chunk 2** (From Linear_regression): "Linear regression predicts continuous outcomes using a linear equation, unlike logistic regression."
3.  **Chunk 3** (From Machine_learning): "Machine learning includes methods like logistic regression and SVM for predictive modeling."

### Embedding Process

-   **Conceptual Vectors** (Simplified from 384D to 3D for illustration):
    -   Chunk 1: ( \mathbf{v_1} = \[0.12, -0.34, 0.89\] )
    -   Chunk 2: ( \mathbf{v_2} = \[0.45, 0.23, -0.67\] )
    -   Chunk 3: ( \mathbf{v_3} = \[0.78, -0.12, 0.34\] )
    -   Question: ( \mathbf{q} = \[0.15, -0.30, 0.85\] )

### Indexing and Retrieval

-   **Index Structure** (Simplified):

\[ \[0.12, -0.34, 0.89\], // Chunk 1 \[0.45, 0.23, -0.67\], // Chunk 2 \[0.78, -0.12, 0.34\] // Chunk 3\]

-   **L2 Distance Calculation**:
-   ( d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{v_1}) = \sqrt{(0.15-0.12)^2 + (-0.30-(-0.34))^2 + (0.85-0.89)^2} \approx 0.05 )
-   ( d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{v_2}) \approx 0.72 )
-   ( d(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{v_3}) \approx 0.43 )
-   **Top-2 Results**: Chunks 1 and 3 (smallest distances).

### Generation Process

-   **Context Combined**:
-   "From Logistic_regression: Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification..."
-   "From Machine_learning: Machine learning includes methods like logistic regression and SVM..."
-   **Generated Answer**: "Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification using the logistic function."

### Output

-   **Answer**: "Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification using the logistic function."
-   **Retrieved Chunks**:

1.  "Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification..."
2.  "Machine learning includes methods like logistic regression and SVM..."
