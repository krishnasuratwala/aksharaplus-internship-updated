It can be extended to handle situations with more than two outcomes (multinomial logistic regression) or ordered outcomes (ordinal logistic regression). Although logistic regression itself provides probabilities, not direct classifications, it can easily be used to create a classifier by setting a threshold probability."

These coefficients can then be used to predict the probability of passing the exam for different study hours.  For instance, plugging in the study hours into the logistic regression equation gives the probability of passing.

Daniel McFadden's work linking the multinomial logit to discrete choice theory provided a strong theoretical foundation.

A key feature of logistic regression is its ability to model how changes in independent variables proportionally affect the odds of the outcome.  From a more theoretical perspective, the logistic function is the simplest way to map a real number to a probability while maximizing entropy, meaning it makes the fewest assumptions about the data.  The model's parameters are typically estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), a method without a direct formula, unlike simpler linear regression techniques.  Logistic regression with MLE serves as a fundamental model for binary or categorical data, similar to how ordinary least squares (OLS) regression does for numerical data."

Each variable can represent the theoretical benefit (utility) of choosing that outcome, aligning with utility theory \u2013 the idea that rational individuals choose the option with the highest benefit. This approach is favored in economics because it provides a strong theoretical basis and allows for easier model expansion.

Finding the absolute best solution (global optimization) is usually slower than finding a good solution (local optimization), so a common approach combines both.  Optimization can involve algorithms that finish in a fixed number of steps, iterative methods that gradually improve, or heuristics that offer approximate solutions."

Usually, these classifiers are trained using maximum likelihood estimation, which is a way to find the best parameter values using observed data, and doesn't require fully Bayesian methods.
